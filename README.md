# JAX Examples

This repo contains a variety of standalone examples using the [JAX
framework](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax).  

The repository structure roughly follows [MLX Examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples)
with a separate folder for each example.  However, a difference is that a shared top level
uv enviroment is used by default and each example directory is essentially a separate
top level repo root containing a scripts folder and a src folder.

This repo is mainly intended for my own reference and learning of JAX and related 
libraries.  While I hope it is useful to others there may be some quirks related to my 
IT setup, in particular related to getting things working on a Mac M1 laptop.
